# Inspiration
Have you ever been wished you could get directions to your destination when you were offline or when you didn't have Internet Access? We wished it too and hence We made TMaps

# What it does
To get directions, you send a text with the following format: "#directions from [origin] to [destination] via [travel-mode]" to a dedicated phone number. This phone acts as server and sends back directions to your personal phone via SMS.

# How we built it
We built our app using Android Studio Libraries and the Google Maps API.

# Challenges we ran into
We faced issues while

running it on different versions of android
receiving messages
sending messages
parsing the JSON we got from Google API
Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have accomplished:

# What we learned
We learned a lot playing with Android Studio and using new technologies for us with it and also linking it to the Google Maps API with Web Programming.

# What's next for TMaps
Maybe one it will get implemented to the general public with a real phone number that will provide help to the people with no internet, or that don't want to get complicated with apps and just want to use simple text messages.
